"""Off-GIL page analysis.

Parsing HTML (dom.py, lxml) and running extraction is CPU work (~30 ms per
real page; ~200 ms with the former BeautifulSoup tree). Done inside crawl
threads it serialises on
the GIL: with 32 threads the measured wall time per parse was 3.8 s. Here the
fetched bytes are handed to a process pool, so parsing runs on real cores
while the crawl threads only wait on network I/O.

The same extraction code runs either way; ANALYZE_PROCESSES=0 (or a broken
pool) falls back to analysing in the calling thread.
