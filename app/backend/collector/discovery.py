"""Discovery planner: decides what the next Serper credit is spent on.

Measured on the old fixed query list (3D studios / Texas, target 100):
77% of search results were businesses already seen, "top/best X" rephrasings
returned 0-1 new businesses per credit, and city expansion was switched off
whenever a state was pinned - so the run stopped at 56/100 after 24 credits.

How this planner spends credits instead:
  * A search is a (phrase, location) CELL. Phrases = user keywords, category
    templates and category sub-niche phrases; locations = the user's location
    plus its cities (see geo.py).
  * Each cell has a canonical key (content words, business nouns / fillers /
    plurals removed, plus the location), so "3D rendering studios in X",
    "top 3D rendering services in X" and "3D rendering companies in X" are ONE
    cell and only ever paid for once. Used keys persist across runs.
  * The next cell is the one with the highest EXPECTED NOVELTY:
        phrase_quality(p) x location_freshness(g)
    phrase_quality  = smoothed share of the phrase's results that were new
                      businesses (x its valid-record rate once measured)
    location_freshness = 0.9 for an untried location, else the location's
                      recent novelty x decay (another phrase in an already
                      searched place mostly repeats it).
    New markets are therefore explored breadth-first, phrases that return
    repeats are dropped, and the run stops honestly when nothing left is
    expected to produce new businesses.
  * Places page 2..N is requested only for a page that was mostly new
    businesses, and it competes with fresh cells at its LEARNED value:
    measured over 1,235 live requests, page 2 returned 2.0 new businesses
    per credit (79% repeats) against 6.1 for page 1, while the old estimate
    assumed page 2 was 95% as novel as page 1 - so ~18% of all credits went
    to follow-up pages. The novelty ratio page N+1 / page N is now measured
    per run (prior 0.35) and persisted.
  * Organic results are a separate arm (see the engine's _want_organic):
    paired with a cell only while their measured valid-records-per-credit
    keeps up with Places, requested on their own where Places coverage is
    thin (< THIN_PLACES results), and offered for every Places-only cell in
    the deep tier, so no search space is lost for target completion.

Running out of searches never ends a run by itself. When a tier has nothing
left worth a credit the engine escalates to the next one:
    base      cells scored above MIN_EXPECTED (the measured-yield plan above)
    relaxed   every remaining unused cell, whatever its expected novelty
    expanded  + niche/synonym phrases and nearby locations
    deep      further result pages (Places 2..5, organic 2..3) of every cell
              that produced new businesses
Only when the deep tier is used up too is the search space exhausted - a
finite, logged terminal condition (never an infinite loop).

A failed search is re-queued with exponential backoff (bounded); one that
still fails is recorded and re-tried once on the next run.
